# HangBoard Timer

An evolution of my original Java hangboard timer, with some bonus features just in time for Winter training. I have reproduced it using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

### Features

- Choose your sets, time, and rest time
- Will beep when you start
- Time counts down on screen letting you know time left
